                William Shakespeare (c. 23[a] April 1564 â€“ 23 April 1616)[b] was
                an English playwright, poet and actor. He is widely regarded as
                the greatest writer in the English language and the world's
                pre-eminent dramatist.[4][5][6] He is often called England's
                national poet and the "Bard of Avon" (or simply "the
                Bard").<span style="color: blue">
                  His extant works, including collaborations, consist of some 39
                  plays, 154 sonnets, three long narrative poems and a few other
                  verses, some of uncertain authorship.</span
                >
                <em>
                  His plays have been translated into every major living
                  language and are performed more often than those of any other
                  playwright</em
                >.[7] Shakespeare remains arguably the most influential writer
                in the English language, and his works continue to be studied
                and reinterpreted.

                Shakespeare was the son of John Shakespeare, an alderman and a
                successful glover (glove-maker) originally from Snitterfield in
                Warwickshire, and Mary Arden, the daughter of an affluent
                landowning family.[15]

                  His date of birth is unknown but is traditionally observed on
                  23 April, Saint George's Day</em
                >.[2] This date, which can be traced to William Oldys and George
                Steevens, has proved appealing to biographers because
                Shakespeare died on the same date in 1616.[16][17] He was the
                third of eight children, and the eldest surviving son.[18]

                It is not known definitively when Shakespeare began writing, but
                contemporary allusions and records of performances show that
                several of his plays were on the London stage by 1592.[42] By
                then, he was sufficiently known in London to be attacked in
                print by the playwright Robert Greene in his Groats-Worth of Wit
                from that year:
